# Unity Card Game Engine Prototype

The idea of this project is primarily a method of me teaching myself how to create card games in Unity.  It also doubles as a re-usable engine for the creation of card games of any kind.

I hope to have example games created using this engine so that people can derive their own from it.  The first game that is to be made using the engine is Solitair (what else?).

*More details to come...*
